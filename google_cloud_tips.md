# Various tips concerning Google Cloud

## First steps

### Prerequisities

* You have Google Account linked to the project
* You are able to log into the project https://console.developers.google.com/compute/disks?project=calico-jax
* You are able to create a new instance https://console.developers.google.com/compute/instancesAdd?project=calico-jax
* You installed Google Cloud SDK https://cloud.google.com/sdk/ into your machine. Use Linux or Mac, Windows can be challenging. 

Do not try to connect to a running instance through the web or Google Cloud Shell. With the current firewall setting it will surely fail.

### Before you can start

You will need oauth2 credentials and SSH key. To manage oauth2 credentials for the Google Cloud SDK, run

```
gcloud auth login
```

and after that 

```
gcloud compute --project "calico-jax" ssh --zone "us-central1-c" "whatever"
```

This fails and give you the error but it creates SSH key. You need to send the public SSH key (`.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub`) to admin (=Ben) to add it to the project. 

Your other SSH keys (e.g. previously generated by `ssh-keygen`) are difficult to get authentication. I did not succeed. 

### Log into the instance

I expect you log into the instance that is already running or create in web interface. For examples, let us expect the name of the instance is `rstudio`. Then you can log into it as follows

```
gcloud compute --project "calico-jax" ssh --zone "us-central1-c" "rstudio"
```

and copy the files into the instance similar way

```
gcloud compute copy-files localfile  rstudio:/whateverfolder --project "calico-jax" --zone "us-central1-c"
```

Similarly, almost everything you can done in web interface has its equivalent in Google Cloud SDK, see [the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/cloudplatform).
